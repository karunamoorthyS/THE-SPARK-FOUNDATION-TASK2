# THE-SPARK-FOUNDATION-TASK2
Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.

After Importing & Fitting the dataset in our model,we got the accuracy is 89.47%.

We can clearly see model performance by confusion matrix and classification report.

By ploting accuracy score depth wise graph, optimal depth for model is 3.
